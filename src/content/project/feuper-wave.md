description: "FEUPer Wave is a game developed for the 3rd delivery of SGI. The objective of this delivery was to develop a racing game using the Three.js library. The theme chosen was inspired by Tron and the rest of the scene has a \"vapor wave\" feel (hence the name). The models were all developed in Blender."
